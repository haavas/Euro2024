The average dane is born on July 31st 1996, making him 27 years, 10
months and 15 days old. A very close call, which was made by a large
number of people. 

Some of you might want to argue that the rounding off
is wrong and that the average age is closer to 28.0 than 27.0. And to
this I can only say that it is very much not how things work with age.
Try sending your 17.5-year old to the store to buy beer.

Many of us got many points. It is perhaps time to introduce the double-ticket of Jonathan and Ina. Jonathan sent in a prediction form, while Ina had filled out the web form. Combined, they are quite competitive.
