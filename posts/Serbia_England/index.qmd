# Sunday 16th June 2024, England beats Serbia but fails to impress

```{r init, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE , warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = "100%")

```

England was the bookmaker's favorite to win EURO2024, but this game did not bolster their standings. Serbia could easily have left with something from the game. 


```{r graph, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,  fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
#| warning: false

invisible(capture.output(Sys.setlocale()))
nettverk <- readr::read_delim("res7.csv", delim=";", col_names = FALSE, locale = locale(encoding = "UTF-8"))
leaderboard <- tibble::as_tibble(nettverk)

leaderboard <- leaderboard %>% arrange_at(ncol(.), desc)

hbar<-leaderboard 
hbar$diff <- hbar$X8-hbar$X7

ggplot(hbar, aes(x=reorder(X1, X8), y=X8, fill = diff )) + 
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-5, 230)) +
    coord_flip() + 
    scale_fill_gradient2(low = "red", high="blue") +
    geom_text(aes(label = X8), hjust=-0.75, size = 5 ) + 
    ylab("Points") +
    xlab(" ") +
    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=18), axis.title=element_text(size=18,face="bold"))
```

We mostly saw this coming, but all the purple shows that many thought the score would be something more exiting.
