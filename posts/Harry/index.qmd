# Harry Maguire is out!

![](Maguire-England-final-770x615.jpg)

It has been announced that Harry Maguire will not be part of England's EURO squad, much to the relief of opposing teams who were worried about being defended by a man who moves slower than a tortoise in quicksand. Maguire's absence will surely be a blow to England's defensive capabilities, as his knack for getting himself tangled up in knots and looking bewildered on the pitch will be sorely missed.

But fear not, England fans, for the team still has plenty of other players who can make up for Maguire's absence by demonstrating their own unique talents, such as collecting red cards faster than a supermarket shopper on Black Friday and providing comedic relief with their unfortunate tackling techniques.

For our competion, it means that Question 12 will be voided. The question was: "Will Harry Maguire receive a red card?", and he will most likely not be able to do so from the stands. We will update the question and the scoring accordingly. Anyone who has answered the ceremonial positive to this question will not suffer, nor do they have to redo the form.

Please note that the two top paragraphs are written by CoPilot/ChatGPT, with the prompt "Write a short satiric text about Harry Maguire not being part of England's EURO Squad" and "add reference to red cards". The rest is written by me.
