    "text": "STV’s Euro Cup competition consists of two parts:\n\n14 questions related to various more or less observable topics that are found at https://nettskjema.no/a/434281\nAn Excel form, in which the outcome of each game has to be forecasted, estimates, guessed, place-your-verb-here. Click here to download the Excel from.\n\nThe excel form consists of 36 games in the group stage and 15 games in the knockout stage. The schedule for the 36 group stage games is set and those games are specified on the left side of the form.\nThe first game is between Germany and Scotland. There are two cells between the two countries , and we fill in what we believe is the final score. In the illustration below the score is predicted to be a victory for Scotland.\n\nWe then repeat this for each game until the final game between the Czech Republic and Turkey.\nWhen the score for all group stage games are filled in, the magic of Excel will automatically fill in the games in the Round of 16. We then move on to put in the scores in these games as well, which in turn will populate the Quarter finals.\nWe repeat this for quarter-finals, semi-finals and, finally, the final final. When the form i successfully completed, the predicted Champion 2024 will pop up in the bottom right corner.\n\nThe grey cells in group stage games 25 thorugh 36 and in the knockout rounds are for penalty shoot-outs. You may fill in these as well, but they have no relevance for the outcome of the competition.\n\n\n\nPoints are awarded for each and every correct answer to the 14 questions. In addition, we calculate the total number of goals scored in the form for a 15th question “How many goals will there be in total? (Penalty shoot-outs excluded)”. Each of these questions yield 30 points, for a total of 450 for the questions section\nPoints are earned for guessing the correct outcome of each of the games in the group stage. There are 36 games in the group stage Each correct answer is worth 25 points, for a total of 900 points\nPoints are deducted for any deviance between the predicted and observed scores. As usual in the Social Sciences, we square the deviance. If the first game is predicted a 2-0 Turkey victory over Italy but ends in a 4-1 Turkish victory, then 25 points are awarded for the correct outcome, before (4-2)2=22=4 and (1-0)2=12=1 points are deducted for slightly missing the correct result. In the end, 25 - 4 - 1 = 20 points are awarded.\nPoints are earned in the the knockout round for guessing the correct teams in each of the knockout stages. 25 points are awarded for each correct team, and a bonus 5 points if the team appears on the correct spot in the playoff schedule. Correctly guessing both teams in a knockout game will thus give (25 + 5) * 2 = 60 points. With 15 knockout games, the total points available is 900.\nFinally, 200 points are awarded for correctly guessing the winner of the Euro2021 cup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nMax points per item\nN. of items\nTotal maximum points\n\n\n\n\nQualitative questions\n30\n15\n450\n\n\nGroup stages\n25\n36\n900\n\n\nKnockout stages\n60\n15\n900\n\n\nWinner\n200\n1\n200\n\n\n\nThe theoretical top score is therefore 2450 points."

Maguire’s absence will surely be a blow to England’s defensive capabilities, as his knack for getting himself tangled up in knots and looking bewildered on the pitch will be sorely missed.\nBut fear not, England fans, for the team still has plenty of other players who can make up for Maguire’s absence by demonstrating their own unique talents, such as collecting red cards faster than a supermarket shopper on Black Friday and providing comedic relief with their unfortunate tackling techniques.\nFor our competion, it means that Question 12 will be voided. The question was: “Will Harry Maguire receive a red card?”, and he will most likely not be able to do so from the stands. We will update the question and the scoring accordingly. Anyone who has answered the ceremonial positive to this question will not suffer, nor do they have to redo the form.\nPlease note that the two top paragraphs are written by CoPilot/ChatGPT, with the prompt “Write a short satiric text about Harry Maguire not being part of England’s EURO Squad” and “add reference to red cards”. The rest is written by me."

As the game developed, it was evident that Denmark didn’t have the quality in midfield to secure a win. As the best midfielder in the world, Albert Grønbæk, was inexplicably left out of the squad, Hjulmand has some explaining to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething has happened to the leaderboard. Øyvind, Halvard and Dagfinn are now ahead of the field. They have all, very impressively, the correct outcome of every game, but Øyvind has the most correct scores. Jostein and Jan Erling also picked up this draw. The rest of us failed more or less miserably."

    "text": "There are 15 questions in the game, and some of them have already been decided.\n\n\nThe answer was Germany, as most of us guessed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"LC_COLLATE=Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.utf8;LC_CTYPE=Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.utf8;LC_MONETARY=Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.utf8;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.utf8\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modal answer is Kylian Mbappé, but Harry Kane is also a popular choice, with Lukaku in thrid.\nHavertz and Kane have two each, Mbappé has one, and the rest have none. Mikautadze, Musiala and Schranz have all three goals each, but only Musiala is likely to add to that tally.\nAs it stands, we gain no points from this question\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"LC_COLLATE=Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.utf8;LC_CTYPE=Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.utf8;LC_MONETARY=Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.utf8;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.utf8\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore variation in these answers, but Bruno Fernandes is the most popular choice, followed by De Bruyne and Bellingham. There is a grand total of 48 entries in the assist list, for a total of 55 assists, but none of the individuals listed above have contributed any of them.\nAs it stands, no points are gained from this question.\n\n\n\nWe don’t know yet. There hasn’t been too many penalties in the tournament, and Kane has not taken any of them, but the possibility remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA large majority of us believe that Kane will score on penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept for two dissidents, we all think that Ronaldo will score. But he hasn’t yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA much more interesting question. So far we have seen the back of three sinners. Will there be another four? We hasten to point out that only individuals on the pitch counts. If a coach or a player on the bench is sent off, it doesn’t count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain our collective wisdom was more unanimous than wise. Sverke, Jacob og Lærke foresaw the avalanche of own goals that was to come. As far as I can tell, mr. Le Normand was number eight so far. At this pace, two more seems not unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA strong majority says no, but the possibility remains.\n\n\n\nPhil Foden was far enough offside that the linesman would have spotted it, but VAR decided to take a look anyway. The goal was disallowed, and a majority gained points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorian Wirtz was benched in the game against Denmark, so a majority again gained points. Our collective wisdom is often impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis question has also been answered. A large majority gained points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I miss Harry Maguire, I am happy to see Marc Guéhi fill the void. A near red card experience yesterday and a total gaffe resulting in Slovakia’s goal, but also a yellow card that suspends him for the next game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the above is currently the correct answer, but Mainoo and Yamal looks like they might just get a goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it stands, it is Luka Modric, but Ronaldo is still in the tournament. Jan Erling & Vilde are currently receiving points for this question.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew names:\nAttaching package: 'plotly'\nThe following object is masked from 'package:igraph':\n\ngroups\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\nlast_plot\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\nfilter\nThe following object is masked from 'package:graphics':\n\nlayout\n• `` -&gt; `...1`\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe championship started with a 6 goal game, which caused the black line representing the actual number of goals to enter on a high note.
