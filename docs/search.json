    "text": "Harry Maguire is out!\n\nIt has been announced that Harry Maguire will not be part of England’s EURO squad, much to the relief of opposing teams who were worried about being defended by a man who moves slower than a tortoise in quicksand. Maguire’s absence will surely be a blow to England’s defensive capabilities, as his knack for getting himself tangled up in knots and looking bewildered on the pitch will be sorely missed.\nBut fear not, England fans, for the team still has plenty of other players who can make up for Maguire’s absence by demonstrating their own unique talents, such as collecting red cards faster than a supermarket shopper on Black Friday and providing comedic relief with their unfortunate tackling techniques.\nFor our competion, it means that Question 12 will be voided. The question was: “Will Harry Maguire receive a red card?”, and he will most likely not be able to do so from the stands. We will update the question and the scoring accordingly. Anyone who has answered the ceremonial positive to this question will not suffer, nor do they have to redo the form.\nPlease note that the two top paragraphs are written by CoPilot/ChatGPT, with the prompt “Write a short satiric text about Harry Maguire not being part of England’s EURO Squad” and “add reference to red cards”. The rest is written by me."

    "text": "STV’s Euro Cup competition consists of two parts:\n\n14 questions related to various more or less observable topics that are found at https://nettskjema.no/a/434281\nAn Excel form, in which the outcome of each game has to be forecasted, estimates, guessed, place-your-verb-here. Click here to download the Excel from.\n\nThe excel form consists of 36 games in the group stage and 15 games in the knockout stage. The schedule for the 36 group stage games is set and those games are specified on the left side of the form.\nThe first game is between Germany and Scotland. There are two cells between the two countries , and we fill in what we believe is the final score. In the illustration below the score is predicted to be a victory for Scotland.\n\nWe then repeat this for each game until the final game between the Czech Republic and Turkey.\nWhen the score for all group stage games are filled in, the magic of Excel will automatically fill in the games in the Round of 16. We then move on to put in the scores in these games as well, which in turn will populate the Quarter finals.\nWe repeat this for quarter-finals, semi-finals and, finally, the final final. When the form i successfully completed, the predicted Champion 2024 will pop up in the bottom right corner.\n\nThe grey cells in group stage games 25 thorugh 36 and in the knockout rounds are for penalty shoot-outs. You may fill in these as well, but they have no relevance for the outcome of the competition.\n\n\n\nPoints are awarded for each and every correct answer to the 14 questions. In addition, we calculate the total number of goals scored in the form for a 15th question “How many goals will there be in total? (Penalty shoot-outs excluded)”. Each of these questions yield 30 points, for a total of 450 for the questions section\nPoints are earned for guessing the correct outcome of each of the games in the group stage. There are 36 games in the group stage Each correct answer is worth 25 points, for a total of 900 points\nPoints are deducted for any deviance between the predicted and observed scores. As usual in the Social Sciences, we square the deviance. If the first game is predicted a 2-0 Turkey victory over Italy but ends in a 4-1 Turkish victory, then 25 points are awarded for the correct outcome, before (4-2)2=22=4 and (1-0)2=12=1 points are deducted for slightly missing the correct result. In the end, 25 - 4 - 1 = 20 points are awarded.\nPoints are earned in the the knockout round for guessing the correct teams in each of the knockout stages. 25 points are awarded for each correct team, and a bonus 5 points if the team appears on the correct spot in the playoff schedule. Correctly guessing both teams in a knockout game will thus give (25 + 5) * 2 = 60 points. With 15 knockout games, the total points available is 900.\nFinally, 200 points are awarded for correctly guessing the winner of the Euro2021 cup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nMax points per item\nN. of items\nTotal maximum points\n\n\n\n\nQualitative questions\n30\n15\n450\n\n\nGroup stages\n25\n36\n900\n\n\nKnockout stages\n60\n15\n900\n\n\nWinner\n200\n1\n200\n\n\n\nThe theoretical top score is therefore 2450 points."
