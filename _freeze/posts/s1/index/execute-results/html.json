Spain came back against France after the French took the lead. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/knock_49-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNine of us had Spain in the final, which is a prerequisite for getting 200 points in the final. If Spain wins, the winner must be one of the individuals who had Spain in the final. There are 7 points between Felix and Vegard. In between there is Anna, but her winner is regrettably out of the tournament. Importantly, 7 points is less than the 30 points awarded for each correct answer for the 15 questions. \n\n\n\n",
