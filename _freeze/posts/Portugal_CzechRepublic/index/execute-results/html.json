Nina is now a point ahead of Dagfinn in third. \n\nI have to admit that I am not sure how to refer to the team from the Czeck Republic, and the Copilot AI is not helping me out. I will go with \"the Czeck Republic\" for now, but any feedback will be greatly appreciated. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/graph-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n",
