Turkey beating Czeck Republic was less of a surprise. Hard to know how we fared, as these were the final games of the group stage, and all the games for the first knockout round are ready. Which means that a lot of points are distributed and a new leader emerges. Or rather, re-emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/graph-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nØyvind came from behind with a massive score. The details must be analyzed in daylight, but it seems Øyvind and Philipp had 14 out of 16 teams for the knockout round, and 9 of them in the correct spot. As it stands, Øyvind is 41 points ahead of Dagfinn, With Jostein in third. \n\n",
